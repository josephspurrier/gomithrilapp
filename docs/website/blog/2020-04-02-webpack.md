This project has really allowed me to explore npm and webpack recently. In the past, I used frameworks like [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) that already had webpack integrated so I didn't have to configure much. With [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/), I followed the instructions on this [article](https://mithril.js.org/installation.html#quick-start-with-webpack) and didn't realize how easy it was to get webpack installed and running so quickly. I was also amazed at how fast webpack generated files when it didn't have much configured.

Once I got it running, I added the following capabilities in this order:
- added `babel-loader` to support ES6 modules
- converted the CommonJS **webpack.config.js** file to an ES6 **webpack.config.babel.js** file
- added `eslint-loader` to check code for formatting issues
- added `html-webpack-plugin` to generate an index file
- added `clean-webpack-plugin` to remove generated files on rebuild
- added `mini-css-extract-plugin` to generate CSS from SCSS
- added `copy-webpack-plugin` to copy static files into the distribution folder
- enabled `splitChunks` to separate out the vendored modules into a separate file
- added `output.publicPath` to set all assets to absolute instead of relative in the **index.html** file

It was definitely a good learning experience and I recommend you configure webpack on your own if you've never set it up from scratch before. [Here's](https://mithril.js.org/installation.html#quick-start-with-webpack) a great place to start.
