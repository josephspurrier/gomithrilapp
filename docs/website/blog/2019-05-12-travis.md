Every project needs a good CI/CD solution - now we've got a
[Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) integration. [View commit](https://github.com/josephspurrier/gomithrilapp/commit/5839a9046f438d2683857c97a7ad3fb5c23abc4f).
Travis will help us check our code when we commit it to ensure all of our unit tests
and end to end tests are still passing. It will also generate Swagger spec to
make sure it's valid from our annotations.

If you haven't already, check out all the work Martin Fowler has on his website - he
shares a lot of great concepts and methodologies on development and testing. A good read is [The Practical Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html) by Ham Vocke that talks about one approach to testing.
