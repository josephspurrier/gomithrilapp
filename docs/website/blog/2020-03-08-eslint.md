I finally figured out how to get [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) to work properly
with Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
[View commit](https://github.com/josephspurrier/govueapp/commit/f85d046355c8088749e0efadcce491f430b59191).

It was quite a challenge getting ESLint to work properly when the .eslintrc.js file is not in the root of the project - the trick was the "eslint.workingDirectories" setting. All the settings are included in the .vscode/settings.json file. I use VSCode open only to the root of the project with no other projects. I also recommend the following VSCode extensions:

- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
- [Go](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.Go)
- [Vetur](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=octref.vetur)
