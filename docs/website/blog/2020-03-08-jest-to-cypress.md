It's hard to argue that [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) doesn't make an
engineer's life easier. I originally wrote tests for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/),
but after seeing a bunch of vulnerabilities pop up in the packages that it's
using, I decided it was a good time to switch to Cypress so I could access the
wonderful GUI that's available.
[View commit](https://github.com/josephspurrier/govueapp/commit/53201272a91e90b555ad296f1db128d1f95a8153).

I'll admit, I'm not a JavaScript developer, but Cypress does make it more fun
to write tests because you can see your progress live. A video is below.
