I really want to use Go modules but it seems the
[community ("⚠️ These tools do not provide a good support for Go modules yet.")](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-go/wiki/Go-modules-support-in-Visual-Studio-Code)
is not quite ready for them yet. Visual Studio Code is one of my favorite tools
by the Microsoft team. It's a really great editor with a great open-source
community behind it. I've enjoyed playing with the latest and greatest tech,
but the older I get, the more I want my tools to just work reliably. I stopped testing
the iOS betas because I didn't like restarting my phone every time I hopped in
the car to get music to start playing.

I need my IDE to allow me to be as productive
as possible so I'm switching back to vendoring depdendencies using
[gvt](https://github.com/FiloSottile/gvt/blob/master/README.old.md) until modules
is better supported by popular tools. We've used gvt on large teams for years so
even though it's deprecated, it still works extremely well for our purposes.

## Makefile

Instead of keeping all the frequently used commands in a text file that team
members have to copy and paste, I added a Makefile to simply a lot of the work.
This should help streamline the process for all the engineers on your team
so each person can run the same commands quickly instead of hunting for that
text file they created a while ago.
