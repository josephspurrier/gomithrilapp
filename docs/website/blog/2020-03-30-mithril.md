I subscribe to the Golang Weekly newsletter. Last week, [they](https://golangweekly.com/issues/305) had a link to a repo for an application called [duit](https://github.com/RadhiFadlillah/duit) which is built with Go and [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/). I did a quick search comparing Vue to Mithril and found this [article](https://mithril.js.org/framework-comparison.html) by the Mithril folks.

Go has always been close to my heart because ["Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient."](https://golang.org/doc/). I've been looking for a JavaScript framework that is built with the same values:

    Why use Mithril?

    In one sentence: because Mithril is pragmatic. This 10 minute guide is a good example: that's how long it takes to learn components, XHR and routing - and that's just about the right amount of knowledge needed to build useful applications.

The pragmatic characteristics also come out in their documentation:

    As a rule of thumb, if your team is already heavily invested in another framework/library/stack, it makes more sense to stick with it, unless your team agrees that there's a very strong reason to justify a costly rewrite.

    However, if you're starting something new, do consider giving Mithril a try, if nothing else, to see how much value Mithril adopters have been getting out of under 10kb (gzipped) of code. Mithril is used by many well-known companies (e.g. Vimeo, Nike, Fitbit), and it powers large open-sourced platforms too (e.g. Lichess, Flarum).

I also really liked hearing Mithril has more documentation than it needs - this saves me from having to search around for the right information and I learn a little more at the same time:

    Mithril documentation typically errs on the side of being overly thorough if a topic involves things outside of the scope of Mithril. For example, when a topic involves a 3rd party library, Mithril documentation walks through the installation process for the 3rd party library. Mithril documentation also often demonstrates simple, close-to-the-metal solutions to common use cases in real-life applications where it's appropriate to inform a developer that web standards may be now on par with larger established libraries.

I tried it out for an afternoon and then decided to convert the project over to use Mithril. Have no fear - I left the old [govueapp](https://github.com/josephspurrier/govueapp) repo intact and then created a new repo called [gomithrilapp](https://github.com/josephspurrier/gomithrilapp) and then copied the code and commit history over. You'll also notice there are a lot of the same blog posts. Enjoy the new language!
