I've used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) in the past, but I decided to give
[Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) a shot and it's been a pretty good process so far. I'm haven't spent much time with React but the project is pretty easy to use. It's great you can build sidebars referencing pages and when you load that page, it will load the sidebar with it. Their documentation is a little limited but I easily
fall back to plain HTML to get the layouts working the way I want.
